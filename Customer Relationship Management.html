		<div id="about-customer">
			<h4><span id="style">About Customer Relationship Management</span></h4>
			<p><span id="style-reference">Customer relationship management (CRM)</span> is<br>
			personal marketing for businesses in order to market<br>
			to each individual customer by using the information<br>
			of previous purchases, needs and wants etc (Rouse,<br>
			2014). <span id="style-reference">CRM</span> focuses on and is driven by the customer<br>
			improving the business relationship with the<br>
			customer but also providing a responsive, quality<br>
			service. (Rainer, Gray, & Pye, 2015). Organisations<br>
			compile information on the customer across various<br>
			channels including the companys social media,<br>
			website, email, loyalty programmes etc using a four<br>
			stage process:</p>
			<li>Socialization - Communicating knowledge<br>
			social interactions</li>
			<li>Externalization - Creating knowledge that<br>
			is shared within an organisation</li>
			<li>Combination - integrating knowledge from<br>
			different sources</li>
			<li>Internalisation - taking knowledge and<br>
			putting it into business practices</li>
			<p>(Khodakarami & Chan, 2014). <span id="style-reference">CRM</span> benefits the<br>
			customer significantly with more information<br>
			available to them, information is catered and<br>
			personalised, and a community is built of alike loyal<br>
			customers. Therefore the customer is willing to allow<br>
			data to be used in<span id="style-reference">CRM</span> which enables organisations<br>
			to create and deliver great customer service, maintain<br>
			a community of loyal customers, and thus creating a<br>
			sustainable advantage over other competitors (Wang<br>
			& Feng, 2012). However using social media as a way of<br>
			building your relationship with customers is always a<br>
			risk as you have to be very wary of what you put out<br>
			there. </p><br><br><br><br>

		<!-- PERSONAL REFLECTION -->
		<div id="personal-customer">
			<h4><span id="style">My Personal Reflection</span></h4>
			<p>My experience of <span id="style-reference">customer relationship management</span><br>
				is when I am online shopping and the items I was<br>
				looking at the last time I visited, or items similar,<br>
				come up. As a customer, this makes very interested<br>
				and curious about those items. This impacts the<br>
				buyer in a way where they stay longer on the website<br>
				and look at some more things that they would like,<br>
				therefore the company is making more money with<br>
				the items they are purchasing and the publicity they<br>
				are getting from the customer. It also happens when I<br>
				am on social media or on my email, the clothes that I<br>
				like and recommended items come up therefore<br>
				making me interested and dragging me to the website<br>
				once again. In my opinion, this technique works very<br>
				well and keeps me coming back to the website<br>
				because of the various platforms it has spanned out<br>
				on.</p>
