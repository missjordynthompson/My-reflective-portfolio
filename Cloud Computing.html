			<h4><span id="style">About Cloud Computing</span></h4>
			<p><span id="style-reference">Cloud Computing</span> is a type of computing that's used<br>
			to store, manage, and process data, that delivers<br>
			convenient, and on-demand access over the internet.<br>
			There are different types of clouds:<br>
			
 			<li>Public cloud - these are shared, easily accessible<br>
 			clouds that provide applications, storage or other<br>
 			services over the internet, for example<br>
 			google, amazon etc.<br>
			<li>Private cloud - these are clouds that are only<br>
			accessible by one person or an organisation, for<br>
			example datacom, spark etc.<br>
			<li>Hybrid clouds - these are a mix of public<br>
			and private clouds<br>
			<li>Vertical cloud - these allow customers to build<br>
			different applications with special specifications<br>
			and needs for different sectors of their business.<br>
			
			<p>(Rainer, Gray, & Pye, 2014). There are lots of benefits<br>
			to <span id="style-reference">cloud computing</span> to both individuals and groups<br>
			including flexibility, disaster recovery, easy access,<br>
			work from anywhere, and environmentally friendly etc.<br>
			(Salesforce UK, 2015). The cloud has increasingly<br>
			becoming so popular that 50% of businesses are<br>
			expected to completely move to the public cloud in the<br>
			next couple of years (Bommadevara, Kaplan, &<br>
			Starikova, 2016). However there are disadvantages of<br>
			the cloud such as internet access is required, access<br>
			can be impaired by something being damaged or by<br>
			man-made/natural disasters, privacy and security<br>
			issues as the internet and computers are never and<br>
			could never be private (Wink, 2012).</p><br><br><br><br>

			<h4><span id="style">My Personal Reflection</span></h4>
			<p>
			<span id="style-reference">Cloud computing</span> has changed the way most students<br>
			my age study. I use <span id="style-reference">cloud computing</span> all the time and I<br>
			upload all my lecture notes, code, images, and other<br>
			personal things to the public cloud (google). This is<br>
			because its easy to access from anywhere I go, I can<br>
			control who accesses certain files, I can work on<br>
			group projects no matter where everyone is, and it is<br>
			just incredibly easy when you have to constantly move<br>
			from class to class. The only downside I have had so<br>
			far would be that if the internet fails (for example at<br>
			university), I was unable to access any files what so<br>
			ever and was stuck for hours until the internet was<br>
			fixed. Although this is the only bad personal<br>
			experience I have had so far, the positives outweigh<br>
			the bad and I still continue to the public cloud for<br>
			everything I do.</p>
