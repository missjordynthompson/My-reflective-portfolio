			<h4><span id="style">About Mobile IS</span></h4>
			<p>Our mobile phones and the ability to communicate<br>
			with anyone from anywhere at anytime, has changed<br>
			the way we do everything to play music, interact with<br>
			each other, navigate around etc. It is has also<br>
			significantly changed the way we go about our<br>
			everyday life and do business:
			<li>Manage our operations</li>
			<li>Interact with customers and suppliers</li>
			<li>Compete in the marketplace</li>
			<p>(Love, 2013). The benefits for a business to go mobile<br>
			are significant, therefore the consumer world are<br>
			rapidly adapting and changing to mobile as they are<br>
			easily movable in space, operable no matter what the<br>
			location, and has a wireless connection (Pernici<br>
			& Krogstie, 2008). Mobile computing was designed for<br>
			workers who travel outside the boundaries of their<br>
			organisations as well as anyone travelling outside<br>
			their home (Rainer, Gray, & Pye, 2014). The <br>
			advantages of everyone changing to mobile is that the<br>
			demand for access to Wi-Fi is incredibly high so the<br>
			government/council in Wellington are making it their<br>
			mission to deliver free secure Wi-Fi using cbdfree<br>
			(CityLink (n.d)). However the disadvantages is the<br>
			environmental and resource constraints, such as<br>
			certain parts of New Zealand there are no service<br>
			therefore your mobile would be useless (Wu, Chang,<br>
			Ho, & Chao, 2008). There are also security issues with<br>
			hackers, lack of information control, and privacy<br>
			issues with <span id="style-reference">Mobile IS</span>.</p><br><br>

			<h4><span id="style">My Personal Reflection</span></h4>
			<p> From growing up in an era where <br>
				technology is rapidly changing and <br>
				adapting everyday, I have seen first hand <br>
				on the changes that <span id="style-reference">Mobile IS</span> has done. <br>
				It was very interesting to know the <br>
				background of everything I have grown <br>
				up with.  With the rapidly changing <br>
				technology, I see no slowing down in the <br>
				future. I believe that our technology will <br>
				make it easier and more convenient for <br>
				people to go through everyday life.<br>
